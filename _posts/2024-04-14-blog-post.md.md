### Internships Summary

During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to participate in four impactful internships. Here is an overview of each internship (for a short version look at my CV):

1. **Dynamics and kinetics of heterochromatin**
    - Supervisors : Dr. Genevieve Thon & Dr. Kim Sneppen
    - Location : Dpt of Biology - University of Copenhagen (Copenhagen)
    - Duration: Spring and Summer 2024
    - Description: 
        As you may know, DNA is not linear in living cells : it is packed. Otherwise, it would be VERY long - $6.10^9$ base pairs with approximatively $3.10^{-10}$ m between each resulting almost 2 meters for ONE human cell! Nature as then adapt different ways to store all of this information (and for other evolutionnary "reasons") through compaction at different levels. The one that everyone knows is the chromosome, the last entity that can be seen through a middle school microscope. But before that there is what is called the chromatin. Chromatin is the first degree of compaction of the DNA. The long DNA sequence is wrapped around proteins called histones and those complexes are called nucleosomes (see Figure 1.1). 

        ![Figure 1.1 - Chromatin to Chromosome by Daniel A. Gilchrist](https://adrien-berard.github.io/website.github.io/images/ChromatinToChromosome.jpg)
        *Figure 1.1 - Chromatin to Chromosome by Daniel A. Gilchristn*


        The chromatin is known since the late 19th century but was mostly studied, as the genome structure, during the middle of the 20th century (see Figure 1.2 for the history of chromatin).
        
        ![Figure 1.2 - Diagram of major discoveries about chromatin by Ramachandran Boopathi](https://adrien-berard.github.io/website.github.io/images/Diagram-represent-major-discoveries-in-the-history-of-chromatin-studies-Image-modified.png)
         *Figure 1.2 - Diagram of major discoveries about chromatin by Ramachandran Boopathi*
        
        The chromatin is mostly in two states : euchromatin and heterochromatin. The first one means that it is light under electron microscopy and the second is dark under the same tool (see Figure 1.3).

        ![Figure 1.3 - " Electron microscopy image showing the classical dichotomy between euchromatin and heterochromatin in a human leucocyte. Most of heterochromatin (black arrows) is in the periphery of the nucleus, for the most part tightly attached to the lamina, while euchromatin (space pointed by the white arrows) is filling most of the nucleus space, without touching lamina.

        *Figure 1.3 - " Electron microscopy image showing the classical dichotomy between euchromatin and heterochromatin in a human leucocyte.

        At the first sight, one might say that heterochromatin is more compacted than euchromatin because of that. But the compaction degree of hetero/euchromatin is still unclear. Indeed, it is a 3D polymer which is dynamic. It's "biological essence" can't be depicted through one image. 

        Another way to look at it is through the scope of genetic information, specifically epigenetics. If you are not familiar with epigenetics, I suggest reading the article "Epigenetics: The Origin and Evolution of a Fashionable Topic" by Ute Deichmann in Developmental Biology (416: 249-254). In summary, the term "epigenetics" was coined by embryologist Conrad Waddington in 1942, but it builds upon ideas from the 17th century. Although it followed the genetic revolution of the mid-20th century, epigenetics has become a significant field of study in its own right. It started to grow after the operon model of Jacob and Monod in 1961, two french biologists who got the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for their research in 1965. Epigenetics is defined by the Cambridge dictionnary as "a branch of genetics that studies the chemical reactions that turn genes on and off". The main questions that arise then are : How are genes turned on and off ? Is it heritable through cell division ? Is it heritable after reproduction ? 
        To study that kind of questions the model organism is the fission yeast or *schizosaccharomyces pombe*. Unicellular organism, this yeast has still the same kind of regulatory pathways of gene expression and DNA repair. Another way to study those questions is through coarse-grained modeling. **[TO COMPLETE]**


        To look at the dynamics of heterochromatin, its behavior, its nucleation, its spreading (local or global or both), the effect of environmental parameters within the cell or the genome, the polymeric effect of chromatin on itself (coiled transition for example), the effect of proteins on the modification of histones through liquid-liquid phase separation for example (and a lot of other interesting scientific questions) I did the following :

        - Model and simulate in 1D the chromatin with local and global changes, transcription and replication effects using Python from scratch (see GitHub - replication of the results of a previous article by Kim Sneppen, 2007)
        - Model and simulate in 3D the chromatin with global changes using Reactive Molecular Dynamics with LAMMPS and the REACTOR package modified especially for this project by Jacob Gissinger.
        - Molecular and cellular biology experiments (ongoing)
        - Creation, with a PhD Student, of a Journal Club about phase separation in biology (mostly about LLPS, DNA repair and heterochromatin)
        - Weekly lab meeting/journal club with Genevieve Thon's team about chromatin dynamics and gene expression in fission yeast
        - Daily meeting with Genevieve Thon
        - Weekly meeting with Kim Sneppen
        - Assisting to conferences and seminars both at the Biology Center and at Niels Bohr Institute (Physics Department of UCPH)


    

2. **Experimental study of swarming behavior of *pseudomonas aeruginosa***
    - Supervisor : Dr. Maxime Deforet
    - Location : Laboratoire Jean Perrin - Sorbonne Université (Paris)
    - Duration: End of spring and Summer 2023
    - Description: *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a pathogenic bacteria for humans in the case of immunodeficiency. It is the third bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections. It is interesting to understand its development capacity and a specific type of motility: **swarming**. This motility, specific to bacteria, is the emergence of collective movement within a bacterial colony, based on various physical effects such as the Marangoni effect through the production of surfactants by bacteria: rhamnolipids. From a fundamental point of view, it is interesting to understand, at different scales, the emergence of collective movement with individuals that do not have direct awareness of their environment, but only through physicochemical effects. This ability allows bacteria to understand their surroundings, including their density. The goal of this internship was to create a multi-scale dynamic atlas - mapping - of swarming in *p.aeruginosa* using optical microscopy. This was done to quantitatively understand and analyze the internal activity within the population of bacteria through MSD calculation using fluorescence. The characterization of polymers produced during swarming in one of the mutants used, which may influence internal mobility by changing the viscoelastic properties of the environment, constituted the second part of the internship.
