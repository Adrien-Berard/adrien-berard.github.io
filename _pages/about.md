Dear reader, I am a biophysics master student currently in my first year at Sorbonne University. 
I am currently doing an internship under the supervision of Dr.Genevieve Thon and Dr.Kim Sneppen respectively a biologist at the Dpt of Biology of UCPH and a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute of UCPH. The goal of my internship is to study heterochromatin in fission yeast. The kinetics of the modifications happening on the nucleosomes and the dynamics of the chromatin will be studied with cellular and molecular biology methods as well as a physical theoretical background : the liquid-liquid phase separation theory.
